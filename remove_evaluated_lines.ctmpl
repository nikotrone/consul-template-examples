# This example shows how to evaluate an if condition over multiple lines and remove the templated lines.
# 
# You can have thousand lines of logic with a single line output, keeping your resulting code clean and tidy.
# Note: by using this approach the result is elegant but you lose line consistency, which can be useful for debug.
# "With great power comes great responsibility."

{{ $x := true -}}
{{ if $x -}}
The value of x is TRUE
{{- else }}
