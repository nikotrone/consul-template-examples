# This example shows how to evaluate an if condition over multiple lines while keeping the consul-template lines empty.
# 
# Imagine you have an application fed with the config file, if it errors will probably output the line that encountered an error. 
# By removing the consul lines from the config file, we lose line consistency so it will be hard to track inside the template.

{{ $x := true }}
{{ if $x }}
The value of x is TRUE
{{ else }}
The value of x is FALSE
{{ end }}
